# GANs-Generative-Adverserial-Network-Training-on-MNIST-Dataset
You can create a simple Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch involves defining two neural networks: a Generator and a Discriminator. The Generator creates data samples, while the Discriminator evaluates them against real data.
